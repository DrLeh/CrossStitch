## Stitches Module

The Stitches module is resonsible for running and managing individual stitch processes. 

The `StitchesModule` performs basic operations on stitches: Creating, starting, and stopping. More complicated and composite operations will be setup elsewhere and the individual atomic steps will be sent to the `StitchesModule`.
